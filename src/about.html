            <p>Chess is a strategic board game that has captivated millions of players around the world for centuries.
                It is played by two opponents on an 8x8 board with 16 pieces each. The objective is to capture the
                opponent's king by putting it under an inescapable threat of capture, known as checkmate.</p>
            <p>Throughout history, chess has been played by nobles, kings, and philosophers, as well as countless people
                from all walks of life. Today, it remains a popular pastime and competitive sport. The world's top
                players compete in prestigious tournaments, and the game has even been recognized by the International
                Olympic Committee as a sport.</p>
